This configuration is inspired by [Obsidian Latex Suite](https://github.com/artisticat1/obsidian-latex-suite),
which is based on the [Gilles Castel's setup using UltiSnips](https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-1/).
The function for math context is defined with reference to [this comment](https://github.com/draivin/hsnips/issues/107#issuecomment-1021000711), and the snippets for fractions are based on [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62545965/latex-fraction-snippets-in-vscode) and [here](https://github.com/draivin/hsnips/issues/18).
